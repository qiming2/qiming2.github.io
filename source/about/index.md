# Who am I ?

Hey there, my name is Qiming Guan, but normally I'll use ktou as my nickname. For some reason, I have been using this name almost for all of my game accounts. I am a big fan of games and game development, and I am a senior college student. Since I really want to master the knowledge during this learning journey, I will post regularly about technical things that I have a hard time understanding and basic fundamentals that are important. Besides technical blogs, I will write things related to games, my life, maybe animes(?), or just about anything that is interesting to share with you!
